# EcoGov Chain: Blockchain-Based Municipal Environmental Impact Verification System

## 🌱 Overview

EcoGov Chain is a novel blockchain-based platform designed for BRAINS'25 conference demonstration that combines data science, environmentalism, and public policy to create a transparent municipal environmental monitoring system.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was developed for submission to the **2025 7th Conference on Blockchain Research & Applications for Innovative Networks and Services (BRAINS)** Demo Papers track, specifically addressing the need for innovative blockchain applications in environmental governance.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Smart Contracts (Solidity)**
   - `EcoToken.sol` - ERC-20 token for reward system
   - `EnvironmentalData.sol` - IoT sensor data management
   - `CitizenReporting.sol` - Community engagement platform
   - `PolicyCompliance.sol` - Automated policy verification

2. **IoT Simulation Backend (Node.js)**
   - Real-time environmental data generation
   - Blockchain integration service
   - REST API for frontend communication

3. **Web Dashboard (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)**
   - Real-time data visualization
   - Citizen reporting interface
   - Municipal compliance monitoring

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-time Environmental Monitoring**: IoT sensors track air quality, water quality, and noise pollution
- **Automated Policy Compliance**: Smart contracts verify adherence to environmental standards
- **Citizen Participation**: Token-based rewards for environmental issue reporting
- **Cross-Municipal Data Sharing**: Secure, transparent data exchange between jurisdictions
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: Blockchain ensures data integrity and transparency

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.12.1+ (Note: Hardhat recommends 22.10.0+)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
cd "7th BRAINS conference"
cd ecogov-chain
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start local blockchain (Terminal 1)**
```bash
npx hardhat node
```

4. **Deploy contracts (Terminal 2)**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

5. **Start backend server (Terminal 3)**
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

6. **Open frontend**
```bash
open frontend/index.html
```

## 📊 Demo Scenario

The demonstration showcases a 24-hour environmental monitoring cycle with:

- **5 IoT sensors** across different municipal zones
- **Automatic policy compliance checking**
- **Citizen environmental reporting**
- **Token-based reward distribution**
- **Real-time data visualization**

### Demo Flow

1. **Start IoT Simulation**: Sensors begin generating environmental data
2. **Policy Compliance**: System automatically checks against thresholds
3. **Citizen Reports**: Community members submit environmental issues
4. **Reward Distribution**: Tokens awarded for compliance and reporting
5. **Data Visualization**: Real-time charts and statistics
